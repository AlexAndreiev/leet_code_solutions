/*You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit.
Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.
You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Constraints:
    The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
    0 <= Node.val <= 9
    It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.
